# Inbox When Ready

### Protect your focus... hide your Gmail inbox by default.

![Inbox When Ready screencast](https://inboxwhenready.org/images/screencast.gif)

Inbox When Ready is a Chrome extension that hides your Gmail inbox by default. All other Gmail views remain accessible as normal, so you can quickly search your archive and compose messages *without getting distracted*.

Ahhhhhh.

P.S.  When you actually want to see your inbox, press "Show my Inbox". Easy!

### Why would I use this?

If you're into batch processing or the Pomodoro focus technique, this extension will probably make sense to you.

If you're okay being frequently interrupted, or you have a job that obliges you to deal with new email very quickly, this extension probably isn't for you.

### How can I use this?

Install the extension by visting the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inbox-when-ready/cdedhgmbfjhobfnphaoihdfmnjidcpim?hl=en&gl=001) and clicking "Add to Chrome".

### What about my privacy?

Good question. The extension requests the minimum permission it requires in order to add the "show / hide inbox" feature to Gmail. The extension does not and never will read your emails or other personal data.

The technical among you are encouraged to review the full source on GitHub, or, better, view the compiled extension source by using the [Chrome Source Extension Viewer](Chrome extension source viewer).
